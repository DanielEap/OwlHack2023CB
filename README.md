This program simulates protanomaly, deuteranomaly, and tritanomaly on an imported image. It then allows you to shift the hue to make the image's colors more discernable for an individual with the selected form of colorblindness.

To run from GUI, open interface.py

To run from terminal interface, open main.py

Currently limited to interpreting JPG / JPEG file format.
